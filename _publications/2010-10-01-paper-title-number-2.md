This thesis proposes an adaptive multi-variable optimizing control framework for AAVs called AERO (Another Evolutionary Robotic Optimizer). AERO consists of a layered software structure comprising Neo-Darwinian “directed evolution” techniques that generate time/energy tuned Behavior Tree parameters that then drive the AAV flight controller actions and attitude postures.
