This paper outlines, investigates and proposes a series of improvements associated with decision making processes when faced with uncertainty in high speed reactive Finite State Machine (FSM) architectures, allowing for greater refinement through adaptive state transitions. Furthermore, this paper investigates recent proposals in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based decision making technology emerging from UC Berkeley’s RiseLab that combines “slow” cloud-based behavior refinement techniques with “fast” reactive techniques operating at a network edge.
