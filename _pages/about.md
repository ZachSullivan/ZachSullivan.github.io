Presently, I am working within [Autonodyne's](https://www.autonodyne.ai/) Research and Development division, where I specialize in developing and refining autonomous vehicle behaviors specifically tailored for embedded platform devices utilized in UAS/UAV/Unmanned spaces.

While at Harvard, I have been advised by Dr. Stratos Idreos who runs the Data Systems Laboratory [DASLab](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvardâ€™s School of Engineering and Applied Science [(SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/). There I architected and published a novel self-adaptive control system for Autonomous Air Vehicles that automatically tunes the drone for best operational energy use.

I am particularly interested in the application of Evolutionary Computation to the optimization of robotic behavior in order to reduce solution space complexity and optimize power efficiency. From this, I am continuing to explore topics in Design Morphology, Genetic Algorithms, and Control System Theory.

Previously I had the wonderful opportunity to work in Software Support at [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html), and on the Logistics Fulfillment Team within [Target Corporation](https://corporate.target.com/), as well as holding Research Assistant positions while I was an undergraduate student at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/)  and at [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start).

In my free time I run a tutoring service to help emerging software developers, in addition to volunteering seasonally with the Community Action Coalition of South Central Wisconsin.
