A Software Engineering Masters's degree candidate at Harvard University's Extension School.

I am a contributor at [DASLab](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by Dr. Stratos Idreos, where I am architecting novel uses cases for self-adaptive systems. I am particularly interested the application of evolutionary programming in robotic contexts, to reduce search space complexity and optimize power efficiency. I am exploring topics in design morphology, genetic algorithms, and control system theory.
