I am a Software Engineering Masters's degree candidate at Harvard University's Extension School.

I am advised by Dr. Stratos Idreos, and am currently operating as a contributor in Harvard SEAS' [DASLab](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/). Presently, I am architecting novel use cases for self-adaptive systems, with particular interest in the application of Evolutionary Programming in robotic contexts to reduce search space complexity and optimize power efficiency. I am exploring topics in Design Morphology, Genetic Algorithms, and Control System Theory. 

Previously I had the wonderful oportunity to work as a Software Support Specialist at [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html), a Logistics Fulfillment Team Member with [Target Corporation](https://corporate.target.com/), and held Research Assistant positions at [Carleton Univerity](https://carleton.ca/) and [Statistics  Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start). In my free time I run tutoring services for novice software developers, and previously volunteered with Community Action Coalition for South Central Wisconsin, ensuring community members have access to warm seasonal clothing.
